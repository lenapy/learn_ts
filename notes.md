What's TS:
TypeScript's type system only helps you during development (i.e. before the code gets copiled)
It doesn't change the runtime code
- a JS superset
- a language built upon JS, adds new features and advantages to it
- can't be executed by JS environment like browser as well as node.js
- compiles code to JS, TSÂ compiles new features to JS environment

TS adds: 
- Types!
- Next-gen JS features (compiled down forolder browsers)
- Non-javaScript Features like Interfaces or Generics
- Meta-Programming Features like Decorators
- Rich Configuration Options
- Modern Tooling that helps even in non-TS Projects

Core Types:
- number - All numbers, no differentiation between integers or floats: 1, 5.3, -10
- string - All text values: 'Hi', "Hi", `Hi`
- boolean - Just two, no "truthy" or "falsy" values: true, false
